Overview
========
reqif2latex is a very basic tool for converting requirement documents from the
ReqIF format into LaTeX to create PDF documents. It is a xlst file, so a xslt
processor is need for doing the transformation.

Disclaimer
----------
This XLST has only been tested with one requirement document and one xslt
processor (namely xsltproc). I did not read the ReqIF format specification, but
was just looking at one ReqIF file that was created with ProR 0.9. So there is
no guarantee that it works with any other file. It is unlikely that it works
with files that were created using any other tool than ProR.

This is the first XSLT I ever created. I hacked it together in one afternoon
while learning about XSLT. So it's probably not efficient and very buggy.

How to use it
=============
Format of the reqif file
------------------------
The reqif is expected to consist of only one specification.

The xslt currently only supports two object types:
  * Requirement Type and
  * Heading Type

The Requirement Type must at least consist of the attributes 'Description' and
'ID'. Any other attributes are ignored and will not be shown in the Latex/PDF
document (for now). Also links are not shown.

The Heading Type must at least consist of the attribute 'Description'. Any other
attributes are ignored and will not be shown in the Latex/PDF document.

Preparing the reqif file
------------------------
Make a copy of the requif file. Change the copy by removing all the namespaces
from the root <REQ-IF> node (not sure why that it is needed).

Convert the modified reqif file into latex
------------------------------------------
You need a xslt processor. I used xsltproc. Run the following command:
xsltproc --output <filename>.tex reqif2Latex.xsl <filename>.reqif

Convert the LaTeX file into PDF
-------------------------------
You need to have a working LaTeX environment and the KOMA scripts. Run:
pdflatex <filename>.tex
